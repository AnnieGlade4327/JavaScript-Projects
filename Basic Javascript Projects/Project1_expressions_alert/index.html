        //strings are one of the seven value types. In JavaScript, we can create strings with double quotes (“) or single quotes (‘), 
        //such as: “Mary had a little lamb,” or ‘Its fleece was white as snow.’ 
        //In our above code, “Hello, World!” is a string. It doesn’t matter whether you use double or single quotes; 
        //they both perform the same functions.
