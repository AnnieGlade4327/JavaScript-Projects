alert("Hello World!"); //Also, did you notice we created a string? As we mentioned earlier, 
//strings are one of the seven value types. In JavaScript, we can create strings with double quotes (“) or single quotes (‘), 
//such as: “Mary had a little lamb,” or ‘Its fleece was white as snow.’ 
//In our above code, “Hello, World!” is a string. It doesn’t matter whether you use double or single quotes; 
//they both perform the same functions.
